\section{Project Goals}

Our project is to first switch the Linux-created GRE tunnel implementation in
Ciao to use GRE tunnels created by Open vSwitch. From that point we will switch
the actual tunneling implementation from GRE to VxLAN/nvGRE based on performance
measurements of each on data center networking cards. After this is completed, a
stretch goal is to replace Linux bridges with Open vSwitch switch instances.

\section{Purpose}

The current implementation of Ciao tightly integrates software defined
networking principles to leverage a limited local awareness of just enough of
the global cloud's state. Tenant overlay networks are used to overcome
traditional hardware networking challenges by using a distributed, stateless,
self-configuring network topology running over dedicated network software
appliances. This design is achieved using Linux-native Global Routing
Encapsulation (GRE) tunnels and Linux bridges, and scales well in an environment
of a few hundred nodes.

While this initial network implementation in Ciao satisfies current simple
networking needs in Ciao, all innovation around software defined networks has
shifted to the Open vSwitch (OVS) framework. Moving Ciao to OVS will allow
leverage of packet acceleration frameworks like the Data Plane Development Kit
(DPDK) as well as provide support for multiple tunneling protocols such as VxLAN
and nvGRE. VxLAN and nvGRE are equal cost multipath routing (ECMP) friendly,
which could increase network performance overall.

\section{Current Progress}
At present, the project is moving along smoothly. Our testing environment has
been set up and is networked appropriately. Each Intel NUC (Next Unit of
Computing) has Clear Linux installed. Come Winter term, we will get Ciao set up
on each machine and begin development on Ciao. Software development on the
project has yet to begin as we have just wrapped up the design phase.

Designing has been quite helpful in developing our understanding of the project,
its goals, and purpose. Because this is a small component of a very complicated
system, taking the time to investigate what a software defined network is, why
it's being used, and why we are implementing the piece that we are has been
quite beneficial.

While in the design phase, we found an extremely useful library for interfacing
with Open vSwitch, libovsdb. Libovsdb is a library written in the Go programming
language that allows for simple and efficient calls to the OVS Database
Management Protocol. Interfacing with OVS is going to be a very large
portion of the project for us, so finding the library is quite the boon. Here
is a quick example of how this library functions:\\

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Example insert operation using libovsdb]
	// simple insert operation
	insertOp := libovsdb.Operation{
		Op:	  "insert",
		Table:	  "Bridge",
		Row:	  bridge,
		UUIDName: namedUUID,
	}
\end{lstlisting}

The above example can be reused for all major operations in the OVS Database
Management Protocol. Other example operations include select, delete, and
update. Using just the operations listed here, we can accomplish most of the
needed configuration changes within Open vSwitch.
