\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}

Ciao is Intel's Cloud Integrated Advanced Orchestrator (Ciao). Ciao schedules and balances workload
throughout a large set of servers. The job of distributing workload over a large number of servers is a difficult
task. Ciao does this well, but has room for improvement in the area of network security and speed. Our
project is to add additional functionality to Ciao's network systems, and enable technology that will
increase the speed that these systems operate at.


While developing its Software Defined Network implementation into Ciao, Intel has found a need for a
more advanced form of network bridge than the standard Linux bridge.
The initial implementation using Linux bridges and GRE tunnels has worked well, but as further
development was done on Ciao, the need for modern packet encapsulation and other innovative protocols
was found to be needed. Implementing a network mode in Ciao utilizing Open vSwitch-created GRE
tunnels would allow the network to utilize advanced networking techniques to increase performance,
such as modern packet encapsulation methods. This addition would be used by those implementing Ciao in
their own organizations or businesses to further increase speed and availability of features in
their cloud.

\subsection{Scope}

Ciao exists as a cloud orchestrator for cloud clusters. It is inherently necessary for the separate
nodes in the cloud cluster to be able to talk to each other. Without a reliable and secure
software defined network Ciao would have little purpose. Utilization of Open VSwitch GRE
tunnels allows Ciao to become more scalable and enables the inclusion of packet-acceleration
technology.

The software we will be developing will be an Open VSwitch networking mode within Ciao,
encapsulating the following goals:

\subsubsection{Replace Linux Bridges with OVS Bridges}
The first goal of the project is to replace all Linux Bridge calls in Ciao with
OVS generated tunnels. A full implementation is needed in order to generate
tunnels using the OVS management database. 

\subsubsection{Open vSwitch GRE Tunnel}

The second goal of the project is to switch the current GRE tunnel implementation
with the Open vSwitch created GRE tunnel. This will allow for newer packet
encapsulation techniques to be used, as well as provide the option to test
packet acceleration.

\subsubsection{Stretch Goal: Test and Implement Best Performing Tunnel Implementation}

The stretch goal for the project is to switch the tunneling implementation. The
two options are VxLAN and nvGRE, and will the final implementation will be based
on performance measurements of each protocol on data center network cards.

\subsection{Overview}
The following section describes more details about the product, including 
product perspective, specific requirements, functionality requirements, and any
assumptions or dependencies used. The section is organized in the following
fashion:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Overall Description
	\item Product Perspective
	\item Product Functions
	\item User Characteristics
	\item Constraints
	\item Reliability
	\item Security
	\item Specific Requirements
\end{enumerate}

\section{Overall Description}

\subsection{Product Perspective}

The Software Defined Network (SDN) we implement will be utilized by Ciao to transfer packets between
compute nodes and control nodes on a cloud cluster. For this purpose the mode
must be fully integrated into the Ciao infrastructure and must behave similarly
to what is already in place.

Because this software will be a component of a larger system, it must follow the
design of that larger system and be fully integrated. As Ciao is
implemented in the Go programming language, so this SDN implementation must
be written in Go. The networking mode must route packets between ports on
different nodes using networking protocols.

The SDN that is implemented must support the following structure of the cloud in
Ciao:

\begin{figure}[H]
	\caption{Ciao Network Topology~\cite{ciaoNetTopology}}
	\begin{center}
		\makebox[\textwidth]{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ciao-networking.eps}}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}


Ciao has several functional components that must be worked with:

\begin{description}[leftmargin=12em,style=nextline]
	\item[libsnnet]
		Provides networking APIs to the ciao-launcher to create tenant
		specific network interfaces on compute nodes and CNCI specific
		network interfaces on a network node.
	\item[ciao-cnci-agent]
		A SSNTP client which connects to the ciao-scheduler and runs
		within a CNCI VM and configures tenant network connectivity by
		interacting with the ciao-controller and ciao-launchers using
		the ciao-scheduler. The ciao-cnci-agent can also be run on
		physical nodes if desired.
	\item[docker-plugin]
		Provides unified networking between VM and Docker workloads.
\end{description}

\subsection{Product Functions}

Ciao networking must support the following functionality.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Secure isolated overlay network - The networking implementation
		must provide each tenant with a secure isolated overlay network
		without the need for any configuration by the tenant and minimal
		configuration by the data center operator.
	\item Auto discovery of compute/network nodes - Auto discover roles of
		nodes when they are attached to the network.
	\item Diverse and scalable - Support large number of tenants with large
		or small number of workloads.
	\item Work on different platforms - Operate on any Linux distribution
		by limiting the number of dependencies on user-space tools and
		leveraging Linux kernel interfaces whenever possible.
	\item Migrate workloads - Provide the ability to migrate workloads from
		a Compute Node on demand or when a CN crashes without tenant
		intervention. Provide the ability to migrate CNCIs on demand or
		when a Network Node crashes.
	\item Encrypt traffic - Provide the ability to transparently encrypt all
		tenant traffic even within the data center network.
	\item Create GRE tunnels with Open VSwitch
	\item Support for tenant and workload level security rules
	\item Support for tenant and workload level NAT rules (inbound and outbound)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{User characteristics}

The users of this mode in Ciao will be educated and technically-minded data
center administrators. They will be familiar with cloud technologies and
networks, both software-defined and hardware-defined.

Due to Ciao's goal of minimum configuration, users are not required to
have the knowledge base of a normal Openstack network administrator.

\subsection{Constraints}

\subsubsection{High-order language requirements}

As mentioned above, it is necessary to write this mode in the Go programming
language in order to integrate with the rest of Ciao.

\subsubsection{Reliability}

The networking mode must be completely reliable and include the ability to
migrate workloads when a compute or network node crashes with little-to-no
interruption to the network capabilities for the tenants and must do so without
tenant intervention.

\subsubsection{Security}

Traffic must be fully and transparently encrypted even within the data center
network. It must utilize Simple and Secure Node Transfer Protocol (SSNTP) to
ensure the security of traffic between the nodes.

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}

Our networking mode must, as mentioned, be fully integrated with Ciao and able
to facilitate communication between different compute and network nodes in a
cloud cluster. Additionally, these connections must be secure and follow the
SSNTP protocol.

The networking mode must also work in Ciao running on top of Clear Linux.

\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}

The network and control nodes will all be Intel NUCs and will be connected by
ethernet ports and a switch. Other than the basic hardware requirements, there
will be no other hardware interfaces, as this is a software defined solution.

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}

A main assumption is that the Oregon State University will not interfere with
our networking implementation. As we had issues with the OSU network in the
beginning of this project, this is a valid concern.

Dependencies include Ciao and the physical hardware (5 Intel NUCs and a network
switch) required to run the cluster. Additional dependencies are a Linux
operating system, the Go programming language, Open VSwitch, and basic
networking OS libraries.

\section{Specific Requirements}

The main requirement is that Open VSwitch is used to create the GRE tunnels in
the SDN implementation. A further goal is to switch the tunneling implementation
to VxLAN or nvGRE based on performance measurements of each. The result of those
performance metrics will dictate which is used.

A stretch goal is to replace the currently-implemented Linux bridges with
Open VSwitch switch instances.

The specific requirements for this project are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Documentation
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Problem statement
			\item Requirements document
			\item Design document
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Implementation
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Replace Linux Bridges with OVS Bridges
				Implement OVS Bridges into Ciao, and replace
				all Linux Bridge functionality.
			\item Open vSwitch GRE tunnels - Open VSwitch must be
				used to create the GRE tunnels in the SDN
				implementation. Currently, Ciao uses
				Linux-created GRE tunnels.
			\item Optional: VxLAN/nvGRE implementation - The second part is
				to switch the tunneling implementation to a
				VxLAN or nvGRE implementation based on speed
				performance. The faster implementation will be
				kept
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Presentation
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Build presentation board
			\item Present at Engineering Expo
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
