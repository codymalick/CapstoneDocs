\section{Introduction}



\section{High-level considerations}

Our software defined network will be written in the Go programming language and
fully integrated in to the Cloud Integrated Advanced Orchestrator
(Ciao)~\cite{ciao}. The Go programming language was selected for
several reasons, including the efficiency of the language regarding both speed
and memory, the concurrency capabilities, and the ease of implementation. Go was
compared against C and Python as alternatives, and prevailed in every criteria
except for availability of the language.

This network mode will be written as a standalone networking mode for Ciao as an
additional option to the standard Linux bridges available now. For this reason
it must be fully integrated with the Ciao networking framework as it currently
exists~\cite{ciaoNetworking}.

\section{Conclusion}



\section{Glossary}

\begin{description}[leftmargin=12em,style=nextline]
	\item[Bridge]
		Software or hardware that connects two or more network segments.
	\item[Ciao]
		Ciao is a cloud orchestrator that provides an easy to deploy,
		secure, scalable cloud orchestration system which handles
		virtual machines, containers, and bare metal apps agnostically
		as generic workloads. Implemented in the Go language, it
		separates logic into "controller", "scheduler" and "launcher"
		components which communicate over the "Simple and Secure Node
		Transfer Protocol (SSNTP)"~\cite{ciao}.
	\item[Cloud]
		A huge, amorphous network of servers somewhere~\cite{xkcd908}.
	\item[Cloud Orchestration]
		An easy to deploy, secure, scalable cloud orchestration system
		which handles virtual machines, containers, and bare metal apps
		agnostically as generic workloads~\cite{ciaoReadme}.
	\item[CNCI]
		Virtual Machines automatically configured by the
		ciao-controller, scheduled by the ciao-scheduler on a need
		basis, when tenant workloads are created~\cite{ciaoNetworking}.
	\item[Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)]
		Encapsulation of an arbitrary network layer protocol so it can
		be sent over another arbitrary network layer
		protocol~\cite{rfc1701}.
	\item[Linux Bridge]
		Configurable software bridge built into the Linux
		kernel~\cite{linuxBridge}.
	\item[Network Node (NN)]
		A Network Node is used to aggregate network traffic for all
		tenants while still keeping individual tenant traffic isolated
		from all other the tenants using special virtual machines called
		Compute Node Concentrators (or CNCIs)~\cite{ciaoNetworking}.
	\item[nvGRE]
		Network Virtualization using Generic Routing
		Encapsulation~\cite{rfc7637}.
	\item[Open vSwitch]
		Open source multilayer software switch with support for
		distribution across multiple physical devices~\cite{ovs}.
	\item[OVS]
		Open vSwitch~\cite{ovs}.
	\item[Packet Acceleration]
		Increasing the speed of the processing and transfer of network
		packets.
	\item[Packet Encapsulation]
		Attaching the headers for a network protocol to a packet so it
		can be transmitted using that
		protocol~\cite{networkingTextbook}.
	\item[SSNTP]
		The Simple and Secure Node Transfer Protocol (SSNTP) is a
		custom, fully asynchronous and TLS based application layer
		protocol. All Cloud Integrated Advanced Orchestrator (CIAO)
		components communicate with each others over
		SSNTP~\cite{ciaoSSNTP}.
	\item[Tunnel]
		Point to point network connection that encapsulates traffic
		between points~\cite{networkingTextbook}.
	\item[VxLAN]
		Virtual Extensible Local Area Network~\cite{rfc7348}.
